# Testing Required

Every feature implementation MUST include corresponding tests. A feature is not complete until its tests exist and pass.

## Backend (.NET)
- New endpoint → create integration tests in `tests/ProjectName.Tests/Endpoints/`
- New request DTO → create validator tests in `tests/ProjectName.Tests/Validators/`
- New model or utility → create unit tests in `tests/ProjectName.Tests/`
- Use `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` with NSubstitute mocks for integration tests
- Run `dotnet test` to verify before considering work done

## Frontend (SolidJS)
- New component or page → create `src/__tests__/` test file mirroring source structure
- New utility function → create `src/__tests__/lib/` test file
- Use `@solidjs/testing-library` for component tests
- Run `npm test -- --run` to verify before considering work done

## Release Gate
- All Release builds (`dotnet build -c Release`) automatically run both backend and frontend tests via `Directory.Build.targets`
- Bypass with `-p:SkipTestValidation=true` only when explicitly needed
