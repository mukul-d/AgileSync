# Changelog Update Rule

Before every `git commit`, update `CHANGELOG.md` at the project root.

## When to update
- Before any commit the user requests
- When the user says "sign off", "done for today", "wrap up", or similar

## How to update
1. Check today's date — if a `## YYYY-MM-DD` section for today already exists, **update it in place** with a full re-summary of everything accomplished today (not just the latest changes)
2. If today's section does not exist, **add a new one** directly below the header block, above all previous entries
3. Group items under `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, or `### Removed` as appropriate
4. Write concise, client-friendly descriptions — this file is shown to prospective clients
5. After updating, stage the file with `git add CHANGELOG.md` before committing

## Format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- Feature or capability described in plain language

### Changed
- What was modified and why
```
